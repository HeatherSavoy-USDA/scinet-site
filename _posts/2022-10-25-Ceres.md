Due to recent issues with Ceres' /project storage hardware, it needs to be replaced.  The replacement hardware is expected to be delivered by end of the day on 10/26/1011 and the works will probably be done on 10/27/2022.

Before replacing the hardware, we will post on the SCINet Forum and update the message of the day displayed at login to Ceres.

While replacing the hardware, Ceres' /project will not be accessible.  We plan to suspend all running jobs before unmounting /project and resume the jobs once the maintenance completes.

While we expect this will not affect running jobs, we recommend submitting new jobs to run on /90daydata to minimize the risk of the job dying due to this maintenance.
 
**All the data will remain in /project, it will just be inaccessible for a few hours.**
