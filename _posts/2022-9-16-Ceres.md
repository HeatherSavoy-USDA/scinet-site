Ceres cluster maintenance is scheduled for Indigenous Peoples' Day on October 10, 2022, and the following day, to update system software.

At that time, the storage system used to host old project directories will be rebuilt for use as an additional project space to accommodate the growing SCINet user base.
To the best of our knowledge, SCINet users have copied all important data from /OLD/project on Ceres to other locations.
All data in /OLD/project will be drestroyed during the file system rebuild.

Queued jobs will not start if they cannot complete by 6:00 AM on October 10.  In the output of the squeue command, the reason for those jobs will be (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance).  These jobs will start after the scheduled outage completes.
If your jobs don't need the default partition time limit, you can specify a shorter time limit using "--time=" option, see [https://scinet.usda.gov/support/ceres-job-script](https://scinet.usda.gov/support/ceres-job-script).

The Atlas cluster will stay up and running during the Ceres downtime.  All Ceres users can run jobs on Atlas.
