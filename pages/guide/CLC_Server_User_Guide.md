**This document assumes that a licensed copy of CLC Genomics WorkBench 22 is installed locally and available to the user.**

# Before You Begin

Email [scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV](mailto:scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV?subject=CLC%20setup) so that the admins can setup the import/export directories and permissions for access.

We need the following information:
1.	Path to your project directory.
2.	Do you need access to the mem nodes for your CLC workflow?

# CLC Server Login

1.	File -> Connections -> CLC Server Connection
2.	Server Name and Port
	
  * **If connecting via VPN/OCVPN**
```
Server name: 10.1.5.210
Server port: 7777
```
  *	**If connecting via ARS Network**
```
Server host: 205.237.112.197
Server port: 7777
```
3.	Username and Password(GA code not required) 

4.	Log in.

After successful login, you should see a directory CLC-\<your project> in the top left window.

# CLC Server vs GRID

CLC provides two ways to offload jobs - CLC Server and GRID. Both serve different purposes. 

**CLC Server** can only be used to perform Standard Import and Export. These tasks are performed on Ceres DTN node for faster transfer rate.

Note that if users select "CLC Server" for any tasks other than those mentioned below, those tasks will not execute and will remain paused. 

**GRID** can be used to run compute tasks on Ceres nodes.

The table below lists the tasks and option to use
